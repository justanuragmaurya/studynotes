# Data Link Layer Design Issues
The Data Link Layer (DLL) is responsible for ensuring a reliable point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connection between nodes in a network.

## Key Design Issues:
1. **Framing**: Breaking the data into manageable frames.
2. **Error Control**: Ensuring that frames arrive without error. This involves error detection and correction.
3. **Flow Control**: Ensuring that a fast sender does not overwhelm a slow receiver.
4. **Link Management**: Establishment, maintenance, and termination of the link.
5. **Access Control**: Managing multiple devices on the same link, like in LAN environments.

# Elementary Data Link Protocols
## 1. **Stop-and-Wait Protocol**:
   - Simple protocol where the sender sends one frame, waits for an acknowledgment (ACK), and then sends the next frame.
   - Drawback: Inefficient for high-latency networks.

## 2. **Sliding Window Protocol**:
   - Allows the sender to send multiple frames before receiving an ACK for the first one.
   - Increases efficiency by keeping the transmission line full.

## 3. **Go-Back-N Protocol**:
   - A type of sliding window protocol where the sender can send multiple frames, but the receiver can only acknowledge the last received frame.
   - If a frame is lost, all subsequent frames are resent.

## 4. **Selective Repeat Protocol**:
   - A more efficient version of Go-Back-N, where only the lost frames are resent, not the entire sequence.

# Error Detection and Correction
## Hamming Code:
   - Hamming code adds redundancy in the form of parity bits to detect and correct single-bit errors.
   - For a data block of m bits, Hamming adds r parity bits such that (m + r + 1) ≤ 2^r.
   - Example: Hamming(7,4) code can detect and correct a single bit error.

## CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check):
   - Used to detect burst errors.
   - Treats the data block as a polynomial, divides it by a predetermined divisor polynomial, and appends the remainder (CRC) to the data.
   - Receiver performs the same division. If the remainder is zero, the data is error-free.

## Parity:
   - **Even Parity**: Adds a parity bit to ensure an even number of 1’s.
   - **Odd Parity**: Adds a parity bit to ensure an odd number of 1’s.
   - Detects single-bit errors but can't correct them.

## Checksum:
   - Divides data into equal-sized blocks, adds them together, and transmits the result (checksum).
   - Receiver repeats the process to ensure the data integrity.
   - Used in Internet protocols like TCP.

# IPv4 Header
IPv4 is a 32-bit addressing protocol.

### IPv4 Header Fields:
1. **Version (4 bits)**: Indicates the IP version.
2. **Header Length (4 bits)**: Indicates the length of the header.
3. **Type of Service (8 bits)**: Prioritization of the packet.
4. **Total Length (16 bits)**: Total size of the packet (header + data).
5. **Identification (16 bits)**: Identifies the packet for fragmentation.
6. **Flags (3 bits)**: Used for fragmentation.
7. **Fragment Offset (13 bits)**: Reassembly of fragmented packets.
8. **Time to Live (TTL, 8 bits)**: Maximum number of hops.
9. **Protocol (8 bits)**: Identifies the higher-level protocol (TCP, UDP).
10. **Header Checksum (16 bits)**: Error-checking of the header.
11. **Source IP (32 bits)**: Source address.
12. **Destination IP (32 bits)**: Destination address.
13. **Options**: Additional options.

# IPv6 Header
IPv6 is a 128-bit addressing protocol and simplifies the header structure.

### IPv6 Header Fields:
1. **Version (4 bits)**: Identifies the IP version.
2. **Traffic Class (8 bits)**: Quality of Service (QoS) management.
3. **Flow Label (20 bits)**: Identifies specific flows of data.
4. **Payload Length (16 bits)**: Length of the data (not including the header).
5. **Next Header (8 bits)**: Identifies the next protocol (similar to IPv4’s Protocol field).
6. **Hop Limit (8 bits)**: Equivalent to TTL in IPv4.
7. **Source Address (128 bits)**: Source IP.
8. **Destination Address (128 bits)**: Destination IP.

# IPv6 Addressing
IPv6 addresses are 128-bit long, providing a vastly larger address space than IPv4.

## Types of IPv6 Addresses:
1. **Unicast**: Identifies a single interface.
2. **Multicast**: Identifies a group of interfaces.
3. **Anycast**: Sent to the nearest of multiple interfaces.
4. **Link-Local Addresses**: Valid only within the local network segment.
5. **Global Unicast Addresses**: Publicly routable addresses.

### Example IPv6 Address: 
`2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`
